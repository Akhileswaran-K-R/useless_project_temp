### Project Description
A fun web service that detects and returns the time shown in any uploaded clock image. Users upload a photo of a clock, and the backend extracts the exact time using AI-powered recognition.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever tried to tell time by looking at a random photo of a clock? It‚Äôs tricky, and your brain might lie to you. Why should humans have all the fun guessing the time?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We use Flask + Gemini API magic to do the heavy lifting and tell you the time from any clock image ‚Äî no squinting or guessing needed. Plus, the Flutter frontend makes it a smooth, pretty experience on any device!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python
- Flask (backend server)
- Gemini API (image recognition & time extraction)
- Flutter (cross-platform frontend app)
