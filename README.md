# CamBuddy üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Nameless

### Project Description

A fun web service that detects and returns the time shown in any uploaded clock image. Users upload a photo of a clock, and the backend extracts the exact time using AI-powered recognition.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Ever tried to tell time by looking at a random photo of a clock? It‚Äôs tricky, and your brain might lie to you. Why should humans have all the fun guessing the time?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We use Flask + Gemini API magic to do the heavy lifting and tell you the time from any clock image ‚Äî no squinting or guessing needed. Plus, the Flutter frontend makes it a smooth, pretty experience on any device!

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

- Python
- Flask (backend server)
- Gemini API (image recognition & time extraction)
- Flutter (cross-platform frontend app)

### Implementation

# Installation

### Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Akhileswaran-K-R/useless_project_temp.git  
cd backend
```

### Create virtual env & activate

```
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run

### Start backend server

```
gunicorn app:app
```

### Run Flutter frontend (in the frontend folder)

```
flutter run
```
